# RideSmart - Motorcycle Monitoring App

RideSmart monitors your turns and show you statistics about your ride. Become a better rider!

## Motivation
As motorcycle riders, I've always wanted to know how fast (more like slow) I was going into turns. So, I decided to build an app that tells me exactly that.

## Usage
Currently, the app is not deployed to Play Store. There are a few features that need to be optimized before general deployment.

To check its current state, you can use Android Studio's AVD emulator.

## Features
- [x] Route recording with distance and number of turns
- [x] Saving and deleting routes
- [ ] Route repetition, with time differences and live speech.
- [ ] Sharing
- [ ] Settings and accounts
